In this report, we analyzed Alzheimer's Disease single cell RNA-seq data to find biomarker.

# Get data

The data we are going to use is Alzheimer's Disease mouse data, single nuclei RNA-seq of hippocampus in TAFE3 and TAFE4 mice ([GSE164507](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164507)). This model is a well-characterized mouse model of tauopathy, P301S Tau transgenic mice expressing floxed APOE-e4 and APOE-e3 alleles.

**Data type**: Droplet-based 3' end single nuclei sequencing with Chromium Single Cell 5' Reagent kits (10x Genomics). The generated scRNAseq libraries were sequenced using Illumina sequencers.
